# Project requirements

The project will use Python and SAS program packages in order to analyze the
activity and the expansion possibilities of an organization.
The project will be made individually or in groups of 2 students for the same
organization.
For each program package it is mandatory to use at least the following
functionalities:
SAS programming: combined or used separately, use minimum 6 of the
following facilities: creating a SAS data set from external files, creating and using
user-defined formats, iterative and conditional processing of data, creating data
subsets, using SAS functions, combining data sets with specific SAS and SQL
procedures, using arrays, using report procedures, using statistical procedures,
generating graphs.
Python programming, combined or used separately, use minimum 6 of the
following facilities:

-   using lists and dictionaries, including their specific methods;
-   using sets and tuples, including their specific methods;
-   defining and calling some functions;
-   using conditional structures;
-   using repetitive structures;
-   importing a csv or json file into the pandas package;
-   accessing data with loc and iloc;
-   modifying data in the pandas package;
-   using group functions;
-   dealing with missing values;
-   deleting columns and records;
-   statistical processing, grouping and aggregation of data in the pandas package;
-   processing of data sets with merge / join;
-   graphical representation of the data with the matplotlib package;
-   using scikit-learn package (clustering, logistic regression);
-   using statmodels package (multiple regression).

The project will be written in MS Word, will be organized on software packages and functions, and for each function you will specify:

-   Defining the problem
-   Information required for solving
-   Calculation methods, algorithms, calculation formulas used (as appropriate)
-   Presentation of results (screen shot)
-   Economic interpretation of results

The project will be electronically and will contain the Word document and the specific files for working in SAS and Python.
The project will be archived and uploaded on online.ase.ro in 2 parts (1 - Python, 2 â€“ SAS programming). Also, all the files belonging to a project will be included in a folder that has the complete name of the author(s) and their group.
