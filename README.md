-   [x] creating and using user-defined formats;
-   [x] iterative and conditional processing of data;
-   [x] creating data subsets;
-   [x] using SAS functions;
-   [x] combining data sets with specific SAS and SQL procedures;
-   [x] using report procedures;
-   [x] using statistical procedures;
-   [x] generating graphs.

## Python functionalities

-   [x] using lists and dictionaries, including their specific methods;
-   [x] using sets and tuples, including their specific methods;
-   [x] defining and calling some functions;
-   [x] using conditional structures;
-   [x] using repetitive structures;
-   [x] importing a csv or json file into the pandas package;
-   [x] accessing data with loc and iloc;
-   [x] modifying data in the pandas package;
-   [x] using group functions;
-   [x] dealing with missing values;
-   [x] deleting columns and records;
-   [x] statistical processing, grouping and aggregation of data in the pandas package;
-   [x] processing of data sets with merge / join;
-   [x] graphical representation of the data with the matplotlib package;
-   [x] using scikit-learn package (clustering, logistic regression);

## Technical requirements

The project will be written in MS Word, will be organized on software packages and functions, and for each function you will specify:

-   Defining the problem
-   Information required for solving
-   Calculation methods, algorithms, calculation formulas used (as appropriate)
-   Presentation of results (screen shot)
-   Economic interpretation of results
