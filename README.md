# Project requirements

The project will use Python and SAS program packages in order to analyze the activity and the expansion possibilities of an organization.

## SAS functionalities

-   creating a SAS data set from external files;
-   creating and using user-defined formats;
-   iterative and conditional processing of data;
-   creating data subsets;
-   using SAS functions;
-   combining data sets with specific SAS and SQL procedures;
-   using arrays;
-   using report procedures;
-   using statistical procedures;
-   generating graphs.

## Python functionalities

-   using lists and dictionaries, including their specific methods;
-   using sets and tuples, including their specific methods;
-   defining and calling some functions;
-   using conditional structures;
-   using repetitive structures;
-   importing a csv or json file into the pandas package;
-   accessing data with loc and iloc;
-   modifying data in the pandas package;
-   using group functions;
-   dealing with missing values;
-   deleting columns and records;
-   statistical processing, grouping and aggregation of data in the pandas package;
-   processing of data sets with merge / join;
-   graphical representation of the data with the matplotlib package;
-   using scikit-learn package (clustering, logistic regression);
-   using statmodels package (multiple regression).

## Technical requirements

The project will be written in MS Word, will be organized on software packages and functions, and for each function you will specify:

-   Defining the problem
-   Information required for solving
-   Calculation methods, algorithms, calculation formulas used (as appropriate)
-   Presentation of results (screen shot)
-   Economic interpretation of results
